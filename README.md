# Parkinson's Disease Progression Estimation by Noninvasive Speech Tests

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodgeneartive disorder after Alzheimer's, which profoundly affect people's life. It is estimated that more then one million people in North America alone are affected.

PD symptom progression often uses the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) that requires the patient's presence in clinic, and time-consuming physical examinations by trained medical staff. 

In a study range of features from speech signal was extracted to establish a relationship between speech signal properties and UPDRS.

## Objective
The objective of this study was to develop a predicitive model to estimate UPDRS from the extracted features of the speech signal.
